# Greedy Manager 2

You are the **resource manager** and your job is to manage gold. You already *have enough* to fulfill everyoneâ€™s need. There is a queue of people in line who either *give* gold to you represented by **positive**(+) value or *take* gold from you represented by a **negative**(-) value. 

You are a greedy person -- so you decided to *get maximum profit* by **skipping** people in queue. However as you are under surveillance, once you start accepting a person's request you can *only stop once* and you need to take *at least one person*. You already have a list of people and their requests, so you can decide beforehand. 

But this time, the people are smart and when a person is skipped, they simply go back to the end of the queue.

## Input

- First line represents the number of test cases.

```py
1 <= T <= 10^5
```

- Second line represents the number of people.

```py
1 <= N <= 10^5
```

- Third line represents the input array/list

```py
-10^4 <= a[i] <= 10^4
```

## Output

Number of extra gold, possibly `-ve` if you gave the gold.

## Sample Case

### Given Input

There are **7** people waiting in queue:

```py
1
7
3 -3 -4 -5 -2 4 -1
```

### Expected Output

```py
6
```

### Description

You decided to *skip* the first `5` people and then they goes back, now the queue looks like `4 -1 3 -3 -4 -5 -2`. Subsequently, you accept `3` more people and then stop. In the end, you have `6` extra gold.
