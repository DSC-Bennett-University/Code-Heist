# Rearrange Students

In a **playschool**, there are `n` number of students in total out of which `n/2` are girls and `n/2` are boys. Every morning -- when they are asked to form a queue during prayer time in such a way that first `n/2` students in the queue are girls while the other `n/2` are boys.

Assume yourself as a teacher and rearrange them in such a way that boys and girls should be interleaving each-other. i.e. Initially, if the queue is `G G G G B B B B` then after rearranging the queue, the result should be `G B G B G B G B`.

## Input

- First line represents number of students (`n`)

```py
n >= 2
```

- `n/2` lines represents registration IDs of girls
- Next `n/2` lines represents registration IDs of boys

> All registration ID's should be >= 400 to be valid.


## Output

Interleaved queue of students.

> If input is invalid, return "Invalid Input"
