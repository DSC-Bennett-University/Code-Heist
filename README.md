## What was CodeHeist?

[CodeHeist](https://dsc-bennett-university.github.io/Code%20Heist/Heist.html) was a six week coding contest organised for coders of all proficiencies, from beginners to well versed. It was powered by the HackerRank platform.

Divided into **6** contests which spanned across **2** divisions. One for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year college students. While the other was open to 1st year college or school students. Respectively.

## What is this?

 This repository hosts the intended solutions to the problems from the organisers perspective. Made open to all post event commencement.

Explanation/Mentoring/doubt-solving video sessions are supplementarily uploaded on our [youtube](#relevent-links) channel which could be used as a reference while exploring the solutions for maximum understanding.

## The directory structure

First off, the repo is divided into `6` standalone contests.

```sh
>> tree -L 1

.
├── contest1
├── contest2
├── contest3
├── contest4
├── contest5
├── contest6
└── README.md
```

To get started, pick a contest you find amusing or go in sequence- one by one.

Next up, every contest is divided into `2` divisions. As mentioned above. You are free to take a look at any.

```sh
>> tree -L 1 contest1

contest1/
├── div1
└── div2
```

Further, every division contains `2` questions each. Every question holding the actual question in markdown format (named `question.md`) and clearly a set of solutions in a multitude of programming languages (list is non-exhaustive).

```sh
>> tree -L 2 contest1/div1

contest1/div1
├── ques1
│   ├── question.md
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   ├── solution.java
│   └── solution.py
└── ques2
    ├── question.md
    ├── solution.cpp
    ├── solution.java
    └── solution.py
```
